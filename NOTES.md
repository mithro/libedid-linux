# EDID

 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Display_Identification_Data

 * EDID structure versions range from v1.0 to v1.4 (plus a v2.0 - released and deprecated)

 * HDMI 1.0 â€“ 1.3c uses EDID structure v1.3

 * Enhanced EDID was introduced at the same time as E-DDC

 * DDC is the protocol for reading EDID data.

   - E-DDC (Enhanced Display Data Channel) is the most recent revision of the
     DDC standard.

   - DDC/CI is a control protocol for contrast / etc
     - Most DDC/CI monitors support only a small subset of MCCS commands and
       some have undocumented commands. Many manufacturers did not pay
       attention to DDC/CI in the past, but now almost all monitors support
       such general MCCS commands as brightness and contrast management.

   structure v1.4
